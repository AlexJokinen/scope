# Access Proof of Concept

## Overview

The Access Proof of Concept (real name pending) is a Django application designed to provide access to Dissemination Information Packages (i.e., access copies of digital files stored in Archival Information Packages in CCA's Archivematica-based digital repository). The application is specifically designed around the custom DIPs generated by [name of script].

The primary application, "dips", allows users to add, organize, and interact with these DIPs and the digital files they contain, depending on user permissions.

## Data Model

The application organizes and displays information in several levels:

* **Collection**: This is the highest level of organization, and may correspond to an archive or other assembled collection of materials. Each Collection belongs to a Department, which allows end users to filter Collections by type.
* **Folder**: Folders belong to Collections, and correspond to an Archival Information Package (AIP) and Dissemination Information Package (DIP), which in turn contain one to many digital files.
* **Digital File**: Individual digital files also have detailed pages within the application, containing detailed metadata from the AIP METS file, including a list of PREMIS events.

## Uploading new DIPs

When a sufficiently privileged user creates a new Folder through the GUI interface, they enter descriptive metadata and upload a copy of the zipped digital objects and a copy of the AIP METS file. The application the nuses the `parsemets.py` script to parse the METS file, automatically generating records for Digital Files and the PREMIS events associated with each digital file and saving them to the database.

In a future version of the application, it should be possible to upload a new DIP via a (not yet existing) REST API, which will similarly populate the database from the METS file.

## Permissions

By default, the application has three levels of permissions:

* **Admin**: Admin users can add, edit, and delete Departments, Collections, and Folders (through Django admin interface)
* **Edit Collections and DIPs**: Users in this Group can add and edit Collections and Folders
* Public: Users with a username/password but no additional permissions have view-only access.

## Superuser credentials (dev)

Username: admin
Password: accesspoc

## Installation (dev)

### Set up environment and install requirements

virtualenv venv -p python3  
source venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Create database

python accesspoc/manage.py makemigrations
python accesspoc/manage.py migrate

## To do

* Add DC elements into Collection and Folder pages (don't display if null)
* Handle user accounts through app rather than admin

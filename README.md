# Access Proof of Concept

## Overview

The Access Proof of Concept (real name pending) is a Django application designed to provide access to Dissemination Information Packages (i.e., access copies of digital files stored in Archival Information Packages in CCA's Archivematica-based digital repository). The application is specifically designed around the custom DIPs generated by [name of script].

The primary application, "dips", allows users to add, organize, and interact with these DIPs and the digital files they contain, depending on user permissions.

## Data Model

The application organizes and displays information in several levels:

* **Department**: This is the highest level of organization. A Department has only a name, and 0 to many Collections as children.
* **Collection**: A Collection corresponds to an archive or other assembled collection of materials. Each Collection belongs to one Department, which allows end users to filter Collections by type on the home page. A Collection has 0 to many Folders as chidlren.
* **Folder**: A Folder corresponds to an Archival Information Package (AIP) and Dissemination Information Package (DIP). A Folder has 1 to many Digital Files as children, which are auto-generated from information in the AIP METS file included as part of the DIP.
* **Digital File**: A Digital File corresponds to a description of an original digital file in the AIP METS file, and contains detailed metadata from an AIP METS file amdSec, including a list of PREMIS events. Digital Files should never be created manually, but only generated via parsing of the METS file when a new Folder is added.

## Uploading new DIPs

When a sufficiently privileged user creates a new Folder through the GUI interface, they need only enter the identifier, choose the Collection to which the Folder belongs, and upload a copy of the zipped digital objects and a copy of the AIP METS file. The application then uses the `parsemets.py` script to parse the METS file, automatically:

* Saving Dublin Core metadata found in the (most recently updated) dmdSec to the DIP model object for the Folder
* Generating records for Digital Files and the PREMIS events associated with each digital file and saving them to the database.

In a future version of the application, it should be possible to upload a new DIP via a (not yet existing) REST API, which will similarly populate the database from the METS file.

Once the DIP has been uploaded, the metadata for the Folder can be edited through the GUI by any user with sufficient permissions.

## Permissions

By default, the application has three levels of permissions:

* **Admin**: Admin users can add, edit, and delete Departments, Collections, and Folders (through Django admin interface)
* **Edit Collections and DIPs**: Users in this Group can add and edit Collections and Folders
* **Public**: Users with a username/password but no additional permissions have view-only access.

## Superuser credentials (dev)

Username: admin  
Password: accesspoc

## Installation (dev)

virtualenv venv -p python3  
source venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt

## To do
  
* Internationalization (French/English interface)
* Add "Edit Collections and DIPs" group to Users and Edit User pages 
* Tie user accounts to CCA domain accounts (phase 2?)  
* REST API for uploading DIPs directly from Archivematica automation-tools (phase 2?)  
* Choose which Dublin Core elements are displayed in Collection and Folder pages (user-configurable?)

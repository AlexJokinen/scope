  <h4>{% trans "How are digital files organized?" %}</h4>
  <p>{% trans "There are three types of records in the DIP Access Interface:" %}</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><strong>{% trans "Collections:" %}</strong> {% trans "These are the highest level of organization, and typically correspond to an archival fonds or collection." %}</li>
  	<li><strong>{% trans "Folders:" %}</strong> {% trans "Folders are within Collections, and correspond to a \"package\" of digital files as they are stored in the CCA's digital preservation repository. Folders typically have a 1-to-1 relationship with File-level archival descriptions in CCA's finding aids." %}</li>
  	<li><strong>{% trans "Digital files:" %}</strong> {% trans "Indivdual digital files live within Folders, and have detailed pages containing additional information that are accessible from the Folder and Search pages." %}</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>{% trans "How do I get access to the actual files?" %}</h4>
  <p>{% trans "Digital files cannot be downloaded individually, but instead must be downloaded as a package zip file (a \"DIP\") from a Folder description. This ensures that any relationships between files (e.g., an XRef in a CAD drawing or a linked image from an HTML file) and the archival context of files remain intact." %}</p>
  <p>{% trans "From the Folder detail page, click \"Download zip file\". After the file finishes downloading, you can unzip the DIP and explore all of the files within. The package will contain the original files with filenames and last modified dates restored to their original values prior to ingest into CCA's digital preservation repository, as well as a METS file and a submissionDocumentation folder." %}</p>
  <h4>{% trans "What is a METS file?" %}</h4>
  <p>{% trans "The METS file is an XML file that lives within each preservation and access package generated by CCA's digital preservation software, Archivematica. It follows the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/\">Metadata Encoding &amp; Transmission Standard</a> schema and contains detailed information about every digital file included in the Folder, including identification and characterization information, extracted metadata, and a log of all events that happened to the file while being processed by Archivematica." %}</p>
  <p>{% trans "We provide the METS file in the DIP in case it's helpful but if you're not familiar with the format don't worry. Selected information from the METS file is also included in the search interface and Digital file detail pages, extracted from the METS file automatically and presented for you in a more user-friendly manner." %}</p>
  <h4>{% trans "What is the submissionDocumentation folder?" %}</h4>
  <p>{% trans "The submissionDocumentation folder contains contextual documentation related to the files in a particular DIP. The contents of this folder might vary from DIP to DIP and archive to archive. One common file to find here in CCA's DIPs is a DFXML (<a href=\"https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Category:Digital_Forensics_XML\">Digital Forensics XML</a>) file, which records the file system information for files on a floppy disk, hard drive, or other piece of digital storage media. DFXML files can be used to compare the current file system metadata for files (filenames, modified and created dates, and so on) against their values as they arrived at CCA on a particular piece of storage media." %}</p>
  <h4>{% trans "Some of the files I want to use are in a file format that is unidentified or won't open. How can I see what is in the files?" %}</h4>
  <p>{% trans "The dedicated CAD workstation in the CCA Study Room contains a wide array of software and can open many file formats, but not all. If you have trouble opening a file, please contact Collection Reference and ask to speak with the Digital Archivist. In some cases, the Digital Archivist may be able to migrate the file to a newer format that is usable on the CAD workstation or to set up a virtual machine or emulator using original software to provide access to obsolete files." %}</p>

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
  <br>
  <h4>How are digital files organized?</h4>
  <p>There are three types of records in Access Proof of Concept:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><strong>Collections:</strong> These are the highest level of organization, and typically correspond to an archive or a collection of library materials.</li>
  	<li><strong>Folders:</strong> Folders are within Collections, and correspond to a "package" of digital files as they are stored in the CCA repository. Folders often represent file-level inventory entries (in other words, the groupings of material within a project or series) in CCA's finding aids but may also be, for example, an item from the library collection.</li>
  	<li><strong>Digital files:</strong> Indivdual digital files live within Folders, and have detailed pages available within Folder descriptions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>How do I get access to the actual files?</h4>
  <p>Digital files cannot be downloaded individually, but instead must be downloaded as a package zip file from a Folder description. This ensures that any relationships between files (e.g., an XRef in a CAD drawing or a linked image from an HTML file) and the archival context of files remain intact.</p>
  <p>From the Folder detail page, click "Download zip file". After the file finishes downloading, you can unzip the package and explore all of the files within.</p>
  <h4>What is a METS file?</h4>
  <p>You may notice another button on the Folder detail page - "View METS file". The METS file is an XML file that lives within each preservation and access package generated by CCA's digital preservation software, Archivematica. It follows the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">Metadata Encoding &amp; Transmission Standard</a> schema and contains detailed information about every digital file included in the Folder, including identification and characterization information, extracted metadata, and a log of all events that happened to the file while being processed by Archivematica.</p>
  <p>We provide the METS file for your viewing here, but if you're not familiar with the format, don't worry. Selected information from the METS file is also present in the search interface and Digital file detail pages, extracted from the METS file automatically and presented for you in a more user-friendly manner.</p>
  <h4>Some of the files I want to use are in a file format that is unidentified or won't open. How can I see what is in the files?</h4>
  <p>The dedicated CAD workstation in the CCA Study Room contains a wide array of software and can open many file formats, but not all. If you have trouble opening a file, please contact Collection Reference and ask to speak with the Digital Archivist. In some cases, the Digital Archivist may be able to migrate the file to a newer format that is usable on the CAD workstation or to set up a virtual machine or emulator using original software to provide access to obsolete files.</p>
